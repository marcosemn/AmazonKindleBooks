# AmazonKindleBooks
Since I bought a Kindle in 2019, I got in love with it.
So I decided to do some machine learning to find out if we can predict that a book will or won't be a 5-star.
I tested Logistic, Gaussian, Decision Tree and Random Forest models to do so and I had some interesting results, including a 95% ROC AUC.
The data base I used can be found at https://bigml.com/user/ashikiar/gallery/dataset/53f3ba12547dfc64bd000a1f
